Ports: OLD data
---------------

On the daemon side (bitmonerod)

P2P Port is the one used to connect with the other nodes on the network (or locally in some cases).

RPC port (Remote Procedure Call) is used to let other applications such as simplewallet or the GUI interact with the daemon, for instance to get information about a block.

Default ports for the daemon are

    P2P: 18080 for the mainnet, 28080 for the testnet
    RPC: 18081 for the mainnet, 28081 for the testnet

They can be changed with following options

    --p2p-bind-port
    --testnet-p2p-bind-port
    --rpc-bind-port
    --testnet-rpc-bind-port

On the wallet side (simplewallet)
---------------------------------

RPC port is used to let other applications interact with the wallet for instance to get balance.
The wallet do not act as a RPC server by default. It can be activated with the option --rpc-bind-port.

For daemon and wallet
---------------------

The RPC data are exchanged using JSON-RPC a protocol based on JSON data format.
This page shows how to use programming language Python to interact with the daemon or the wallet via RPC.

The bitmonerod defaults are:

    Mainnet:
    P2P: 18080
    RPC:18081

    Testnet:
    P2P: 28080
    RPC: 28081

The wallet's RPC port has no default.
Wallet and daemon may use 53 for DNS, which is optional.
